This assignment was to take a simple Java program and port it to C#. Before starting this assignment, I had no prior C# experience but always had heard it was similar to Java. I suppose in a sense this is true. The general syntax was essentialy
the same so I did not have to learn new syntax. C# however, has many new keywords that do the same thing in Java but have different names and different usage. I had to look at several C# examples online to see how it is written differently. I think trying to port a program into such a similar language is more difficult than porting to smalltalk, because the close similarity makes me forget that I am not using Java.
